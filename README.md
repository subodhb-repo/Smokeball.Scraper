# Smokeball Scraper

The CEO from Smokeball is very interested in SEO and how this can improve Sales. Every morning he logs in to google.com.au and types in the same key words “conveyancing software” and counts down to see where and how many times their company, www.smokeball.com.au sits on the list. 

The purpose of this project is to receives a string of keywords, and a string URL. This is then processed to return a string of numbers for where the resulting URL is found in Google. For 
example “1, 10, 33” or “0”.
